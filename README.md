# Learning Points
I wasn't able to apply a local storage for this assignment. This week was so cramped with another big assignment in the horizon and had very little time to learn the new material. I delayed my research on this concept so that I can at least contribute to my group project. I realized now that it affected how this assignment was executed. I will be applying myself better for a better schedule to keep up with the class. 

# Contributors
Shout out to Kyle Vance for always having my back and my group members from my project for giving me the feedback to excecute this assignment.
